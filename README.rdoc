== DBC Week 6 project - first rails app :-)

After 5 weeks of fundamentals and plain ruby, we were introduced to the massive convenience of Rails.
Happy to have it as a tool, but also a little scary to have a lot of magic happening "behind my back".

This app is my first rails project, it's a URL shortener and as a bonus it also mewbifies the site :-)

The app is deployed on heroku - http://shortmew.herokuapp.com
